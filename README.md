Project Title: Comprehensive Sales and Returns Dashboard

Project Description:

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard for a company. It offers intuitive analysis, supporting informed decision-making. The dashboard integrates sales and returns data tables with different dimensions tables, using modelled  relationships and custom DAX codes to ensure accurate and meaningful insights.

The dashboard is organized into four main tabs with a convenient common navigation bar:

1. Executive Dashboard: Provides a bird's-eye view using matrix tables, KPI cards, bar and line charts. Also includes a retractable slicer panel for dynamic filtering and data exploration.

2. Map: Features a bubble chart to visually represent geographical data, along with a slicer.

3. Customer Details: Displays detailed customer insights through tables, line charts, and donut charts, supplemented by slicers for focused analysis.

4. Product Details: Showcases product-specific metrics using gauge charts and line charts, enhanced by field and range parameters.
